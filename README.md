A wrapper for the Amazon Chime SDKs. Allows to join Chime meetings using audio and video.

## Android

ðŸš© **Chime does not work on Android emulators!**

https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-android  
"NOTE: Please make sure that you are running on ARM supported devices (real devices) or simulator with arm supported. We do not support x86 currently, so simulators with x86 will not work."  

The example works on Android emulators as far as showing the version of the SDK.  
Anything else will trigger ```UnsatisfiedLinkError```.

**Instructions for your app**

* Set the min SDK version to 23 or above.
(Chime needs API level 21, but platform views cannot be displayed below API level 23.)

**Used Versions**
* [v0.17.1](https://github.com/aws/amazon-chime-sdk-android/releases/tag/v0.17.1)
